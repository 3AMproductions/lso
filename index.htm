  <p id="content">Libertarianism, or classical-liberalism, is a belief system where liberty and freedom are considered to be highly desirable qualities of a society's institutions. Because the Libertarian Studies Organization (<acronym title="Libertarian Studies Organization">LSO</acronym>) is a group devoted to the study of libertarianism, being a member does not presuppose any political or ideological position. Rather, we are an association of thinkers who gather together to hear speakers, have discussions and hold social functions, all organized around the theme of exploring the question how much freedom people should have. All are welcome to attend <acronym title="Libertarian Studies Organization">LSO</acronym> functions and to offer input in the planning of events.</p>
